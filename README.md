# pyglsim [V 0.1]
A Python / OpenGL framework for teaching simulation methods 

## About pyglsim
pyglsim is a little project for upcoming iterations of my simulation methods course -- previously CS 290 AJ at the University of Regina computer science department. 

The purpose of pyglsim is to provide students with an easy to hack graphical interface to work with in order to program various physical simulations in python -- without any extra frills. 

## Features 
In progress:
* 3D Rendering of gl-defined objects * 
* External "classes" that allow for the programming of object motion
* Everything else...
